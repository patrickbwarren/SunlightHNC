# A plot of the chemical potential difference against x reveals nearly
# linear behaviour, which can be confirmed in Monte-Carlo simulations
# (unreported).  This linear dependence can be represented by Delta F
# = chi (1 - 2x) where chi is the Flory chi-parameter and is the basic
# reason why DPD is so good at representing fluid mixtures which fit
# Flory-Huggins (regular solution) theory.

# The following table contains unpublished Monte-Carlo calculations of
# the chemical potential difference, using trial particle identity
# swaps.
